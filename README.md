## Tools 

- SQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, and querying.
- Power Query: Employed for data transformation and manipulation.
- PowerBI: Utilized for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations, including buttons, tooltips, filters, page navigation, and quick measures.



## Data Cleaning and Transformation

In the data cleaning process, missing values were identified in the "arrival delay" column. To address this issue, the "Replace Values" function in Power Query was utilized. The missing values were replaced with '0' using the mode as the replacement value. By ensuring the integrity of the dataset, it was prepared for subsequent analysis, contributing to the reliability and accuracy of the insights derived from the data.



## Data Analysis
